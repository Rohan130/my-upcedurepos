### As per the question 1, Yeah I kept in mind to keep a space for changing the code for later.
### I have used the concept of OOPs to keep the code modular and easy to change in future. like can add salarycalculator or Taxed salary calculator.
### even for question 2, Use ArrayList instead of an array of size 100. it can be changed for any other number.
